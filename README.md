Top Dividend Growth Stocks for 2025
Dividend growth stocks are companies that have a proven track record of consistently increasing their dividends over many years, making them attractive for long-term income investors seeking both yield and reliability. These often include S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (25+ consecutive years of increases) and Dividend Kings (50+ years). Based on recent analyses as of November 2025, I've compiled a list of the top 10 by current dividend yield from these elite groups. Yields are forward estimates and can fluctuate with stock prices.

These selections prioritize high yields while ensuring strong histories of growth. Consider factors like payout ratios and sector exposure before investing—e.g., consumer staples like HRL offer stability, while REITs like O provide monthly payouts. For a full list of 69 Aristocrats or 55 Kings, check specialized resources. If you'd like details on specific stocks or a custom filter (e.g., by sector), let me know!

60 monthly dividend stocks exist, most of them fall into just a handful of industries, possess meaningful risk factors, or are too small for conservative investors to consider.
Stocks should always be purchased based on their business quality and valuation, not their dividend payout schedule.
It's important to remember that most income investors will still create their own monthly dividend portfolios by owning a diversified group of dividend-paying stocks, even if only a few of them pay dividends monthly.
